# Call for Contributions at "3rd High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing" (HPC+QC'26)

As part of the [PASC'26 Conference](https://pasc26.pasc-conference.org/), we would like to submit a proposal for a [Minisymposium](https://pasc26.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-minisymposia/) on the subject of "High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing". This is the 3rd edition of the Minisymposium we organized at [PASC'24](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/session/?sess=sess160) and [PASC'25](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/session/?sess=sess123).

The goal of our proposal is to establish a regular mini-symposium event at PASC as a yearly venue, where researchers and developers can discuss their experiences with application development with QC algorithms, specifically related to the integration of applications currently running on "traditional" HPC systems, which aim to use QC devices as an accelerator.

Considered topics are:
- Theoretical development of QC algorithms;
- QC software development;
- Integration of QC systems with the existing HPC infrastructure;
- Use QC as an accelerator for HPC applications;
- QC simulations.

The third edition will provide attendees with updates on the current state-of-the-art, trends, and developments in this domain, while engaging with experts in the field, enabling knowledge transfer and fostering future collaborations. Speakers will describe their experiences, the techniques they implemented, and the subsequent new developments, which will cover a wide range of perspectives, including those from domain scientists and technical engineers. The mini-symposium’s topics are relevant to all application developers and users, spanning the scientific fields represented at the conference, and are especially aligned with the conference theme “Building Trust in Science through HPC Co-Design”.

## Submission process

A presentation at the PASC minisymposium consists of a 30-minute slot (including 5 minutes for Q&A), for a total of 4 presentations.
Following the PASC rules for the [Minisymposia](https://pasc26.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-minisymposia/),
precedence is given to **early-career researchers** (at least one of the presenters).
A speaker is considered early-career if they have less than 7 years of full-time experience
in the field since their last degree
(the 7-year window may be extended for extenuating circumstances such as parental or medical leave).
Then, the 4 presenters should come from different institutions.
Applications in which all presenters represent different institutions will be given higher priority during the evaluation process.
Finally, preference will be given to sessions where speakers give only one talk during the entire conference.

# Call for Contributions

If you are interested to join the proposal for the submission as a speaker, please send an email to `alfio.lazzaro AT hpe.com` with a draft of:

* a title of the presentation (max 10 words);
* authors and speakers;
* institutions;
* short abstract (50 words).

**DEADLINE IS 13 JANUARY 2026 (NO EXTENSIONS!)**

If the minisymposium proposal is accepted, then presentation titles and abstracts (200 words) will be requested from each speaker (deadline 15 March 2026),
where there will be the opportunity to revision the abstracts and titles for publication in the conference program.

> **_NOTE:_** No promise that the minisymposium will take place at PASC26 until we will receive the acceptance notifications (18 February 2026). Then, speakers have to organize their travel and registration to the conference on their own. NO REMOTE PRESENTATIONS ARE POSSIBLE.

**The slides and a report of the event will be published.**

## Diversity and Inclusivity
We will invite speakers from multiple institutions based in different countries, with an aim to include diverse and underrepresented groups, including geographic, gender, ethnicity, and early career categories. We will post a notice that we will require that participants follow a safe and harassment free environment for all.
