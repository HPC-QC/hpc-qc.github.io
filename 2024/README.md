# Call for Contributions at "High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing" (HPC+QC'24)

As part of the [PASC'24 Conference](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/), we would like to submit a proposal for a [Minisymposium](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-minisymposia/) on the subject of "High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing".

The goal of our proposal is to establish a regular mini-symposium event at PASC as a yearly venue, where researchers and developers can discuss their experiences with applications development with QC algorithms, specifically related to the integration of applications currently running on "traditional" HPC systems, which aim to use QC devices as an accelerator. Considered topics are:
- Theoretical development of QC algorithms;
- QC software development;
- Integration of QC systems with the existing HPC infrastructure;
- Use QC as an accelerator for HPC applications;
- QC simulations.
